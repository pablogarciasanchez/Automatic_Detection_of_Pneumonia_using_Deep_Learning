# Automatic_Detection_of_Pneumonia_using_Deep_Learning

Collaborative project: Implementation of a CNN for detecting pneumonia in children using chest X-ray images. The PneumoniaMNIST dataset from MedMNIST was employed. I fine-tuned several pretrained CNN from ImageNet and compared them with the same networks (and other models) trained from scratch. The goal was to analyze the viability and benefits of transfer learning and fine-tuning. Developed in Python using FastAI.
